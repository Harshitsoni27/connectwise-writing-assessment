# ConnectWise Assessment 

I updated the “Putting a shortcut on your desktop” section from the old Windows 95 document for Windows 11. While creating this document, I made sure the content stays to the point and succinct, with crisp steps for creating shortcuts for Applications, Files/Folders, and Websites. I’ve also added supporting visual cues (gifs) and an alternative method.

For non-technical users, I believe the drag-and-drop method is the best. It’s visually intuitive, fastest, requires the fewest clicks, and avoids forcing users to navigate through complex submenus.

While alternatives like “Send to Desktop” do exist, they add unnecessary complexity. They require users to go through nested menus (Right-click> Show more options > Send to > Desktop), which can be confusing for beginners who may not understand folder structures or file locations.

I also included New > Shortcut as a dependable fallback option.
